            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Middle Aged Club, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>



            <ul>
                <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that
                    we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>



                <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>



                <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared
                    publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>



                <li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>



                <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
            </ul>



            <p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">What This Policy Covers</h3>



            <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website as “Services.” </p>



            <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services, like our Facebook
                Group, that have a separate privacy policy.</p>



            <p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have
                with respect to that information.</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Information We Collect</h3>



            <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to
                communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>



            <p>We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically
                through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>



            <p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some
                examples:</p>



            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic account information:&nbsp;</strong>We ask for basic information from you in order to set
                    up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide
                    an email address and password, along with a username or name — and that’s it. You may provide us with
                    more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don’t require that
                    information to create a WordPress.com account.</li>



                <li><strong>Public profile information:</strong>&nbsp;If you have an account with us, we collect the
                    information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a account on our website,
                    your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public
                    profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that —
                    public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>



                <li><strong>Content information:&nbsp;</strong>You might provide us with information about you in draft and
                    published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media
                    or files you upload).</li>



                <li><strong>Communications with us :&nbsp;</strong>You may also provide us with information when you
                    communicate with us about a support question, post comments in our public forums. When you communicate
                    with us via form, email, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications
                    (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>
            </ul>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></h4>



            <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>



            <ul>
                <li><strong>Log information:</strong>&nbsp;Like most online service providers, we collect information that
                    web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP
                    address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access,
                    operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services —
                    for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.</li>



                <li><strong>Usage information:</strong>&nbsp;We collect information about your usage of our Services. We use
                    this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our
                    Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
                </li>



                <li><strong>Location information:</strong>&nbsp;We may determine the approximate location of your device
                    from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people
                    visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise
                    location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us
                    to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.</li>



                <li><strong>Stored information:</strong>&nbsp;We may access information stored on your mobile device via our
                    mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For
                    example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our
                    Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the
                    sunrise to your website.</li>



                <li><strong>Interactions with other users’ sites:</strong>&nbsp;We collect some information about your
                    interactions with other users’ sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your
                    “Likes” and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for
                    example,&nbsp;recommend posts&nbsp;we think may interest you. </li>



                <li><strong>Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</strong>&nbsp;A cookie is a string of
                    information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to
                    the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code
                    placed on websites and emails. We use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify
                    and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand
                    email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies
                    and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see
                    our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.</li>
            </ul>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em></h4>



            <p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:</p>



            <ul>
                <li><strong>Third Party Login:</strong>&nbsp;If you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through
                    another service (like Google) we’ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your
                    username, your email address)</li>



                <li><strong>Social Sharing Services:&nbsp;</strong>If you connect our website or account to a social media
                    service (like Twitter), we’ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile
                    information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.</li>
            </ul>



            <p>The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.</p>



            <p>Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our
                users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other
                mailers advertising our Services.</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">How and Why We Use Information</h3>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Purposes for Using Information</em></h4>



            <p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>



            <ul>
                <li><strong>To provide our Services.</strong>&nbsp;For example, to set up and maintain your account, host
                    the website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and
                    verify user information.</li>



                <li><strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong>&nbsp;For example, by
                    providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and
                    analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users
                    will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services
                    easier to use.</li>



                <li><strong>To place and manage ads in our advertising program.</strong>&nbsp;For example, to place ads on
                    our users’ sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad
                    performance.</li>



                <li><strong>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our
                        marketing.</strong>&nbsp;For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users
                    (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time),
                    advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people
                    purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user
                    retention.</li>



                <li><strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong>&nbsp;For example, by detecting
                    security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
                    activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of
                    Middle Aged Club and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating
                    Services.</li>



                <li><strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong>&nbsp;For example, by monitoring, debugging,
                    repairing, and preventing issues.</li>



                <li><strong>To customize the user experience.</strong>&nbsp;For example, to personalize your experience by
                    serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our
                    Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading
                    pleasure.</li>



                <li><strong>To communicate with you.</strong>&nbsp;For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback,
                    share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on our services; texting you
                    to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest
                    to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If
                    you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>
            </ul>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</em></h4>



            <p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you
                under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:</p>



            <p>(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or
                other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable
                access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or</p>


            <p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</p>



            <p>(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our
                Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our
                Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and
                to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and
                to personalize your experience; or</p>



            <p>(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access
                and analyze them later on,</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sharing Information</h3>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>How We Share Information</em></h4>



            <p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.
                These are spelled out below.</p>



            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong>&nbsp;We may disclose information about you to
                    our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or
                    process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow
                    this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>



                <li><strong>Third-party vendors:</strong>&nbsp;We may share information about you with third-party vendors
                    who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you
                    or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you We require vendors to agree
                    to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. </li>



                <li><strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong>&nbsp;We may disclose information about you in
                    response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. </li>



                <li><strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong>&nbsp;We may disclose information about you
                    when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
                    of Middle Aged Club, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief
                    that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we&nbsp;may disclose information
                    related to the emergency without delay.</li>



                <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong>&nbsp;In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or
                    acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Middle
                    Aged Club goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets
                    that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy
                    Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue
                    to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>



                <li><strong>With your consent:</strong>&nbsp;We may share and disclose information with your consent or at
                    your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to
                    do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.</li>



                <li><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong>&nbsp;We may share information that has been
                    aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance,
                    we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your
                    email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>



                <li><strong>Published support requests:</strong>&nbsp;If you send us a request for assistance (for example,
                    via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that
                    request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>
            </ul>



            <p>We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users’ data. We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell
                your personal information to data brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies that want
                to spam you with marketing emails.</p>



            <p>We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own, and the revenue they generate lets us
                offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a voice.</p>


            <p>Under a new California law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), some personalized advertising you
                see online and on our services might be considered a “sale” even though we don’t share information that
                identifies you personally, like your name or email address, as part of our advertising program.</p>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Information Shared Publicly</em></h4>



            <p>Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly.</p>



            <p>That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website,
                and your “Likes” and comments on other websites are all available to others — and we hope they get a lot of
                views!</p>

            <p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Long We Keep Information</h3>



            <p>We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect
                and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally
                required to keep it.</p>



            <p>For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to Middle Aged Club, like the
                visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for
                this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Middle Aged Club and investigate
                issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Security</h3>



            <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against
                unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our
                Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Your Rights</h3>



            <p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the
                scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights
                regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></h4>



            <p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain
                rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the
                rights to:</p>



            <ul>
                <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>



                <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>



                <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>



                <li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>



                <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>



            <p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</em></h4>



            <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional
                information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal
                information, and how and why we use it.</p>



            <p>The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that
                term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of
                personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>



            <ul>
                <li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>



                <li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>



                <li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research
                    survey for us);</li>



                <li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the
                    actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);</li>



                <li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li>



                <li>Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
                </li>



                <li>Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you
                    are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and</li>



                <li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>
            </ul>



            <p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions
                provided by the law, including the right to:</p>



            <ul>
                <li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or
                    commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information
                    came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we
                    collect about you;</li>



                <li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>



                <li>Opt out of any sale of personal information; and</li>



                <li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li>



                <li></li>
            </ul>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>The CCPA &amp; Personalized Advertising in Our Ads
                        Program</em></strong></h4>



            <p>Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as
                many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users’ sites as well as some of our own sites, and the
                revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an
                obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their
                own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device
                identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those
                advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users’ sites and
                some of our own.</p>



            <p>The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity
                (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate
                location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a “sale” of information
                under the CCPA. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you
                personally, like your name or contact information. We don’t knowingly sell personal information of those
                under 16. Learn how you can opt out by going to&nbsp;<a

                    Information</a>.</p>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Contacting Us About These Rights</em></h4>



            <p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we
                offer, but if you aren’t able to or you’d like to contact us about one of the other rights, go to the
                Contact form.</p>



            <p>When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we’ll need to verify that you are the right
                person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us
                from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a
                request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity
                with us.</p>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</em></h4>



            <p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide
                analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies
                (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online
                services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about
                you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things,
                analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver ads that may be more
                targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by our
                website and does not cover the collection of information by any third-party advertisers or analytics
                providers.</p>



            <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Visitors to Our Users’ Websites</em></h4>



            <p>We also process information about visitors to our users’ websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance
                with our user agreements. Please note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for
                their websites isn’t covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage our users to post a privacy policy that
                accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information. </p>



            <p>Users control the content posted on their sites, so any disputes regarding content on a user’s site should be
                made directly to the site owner, through their “contact us” page, at an email address they provide, or by
                leaving a comment on the site.</p>



            <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy Policy Change</h3>



            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Middle Aged Club may change its Privacy Policy from time to
                time. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make
                changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional
                notice. Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated
                policy.</p>



            <p>That’s it! Thanks for reading.</p>
